### KEYWORD METHOD
The keyword method is especially recommended for teaching / learning vocabulary. 
In order to use this method, one has to associate a new foreign word with a similar-sounding native word and then create an image combining both of them. 
For example, a Polish learner of English could associate the word *shop* with *szop* (they sound similar) and imagine the animal selling clothes in a shopping centre. 
The more absurd or the funnier the image, the more memorable it is. The word szop becomes the keyword which helps the learner recall the meaning of shop. 
Similarly, a Polish learner of Spanish could associate the word carta (list) with karton and imagine a postman carrying a huge letter in a carton box.

It is also possible to use a modified version of the keyword method, called the **literal-keyword technique**, for teaching / learning English phrasal verbs. The technique differs from the original keyword method in that it does not make use of acoustic links with the native language but requires the learner to find keywords in English, which is actually easier. So if one would like to learn the phrasal verb *give in to somebody* (surrender), one has to imagine the verb itself as an action performed by someone and change the prepositions into keywords (i.e. words that sound similar): *a tin for in and two for to*. The phrasal verb can be then exemplified by the sentence: *Finally, we had to give in to the enemy.*, and illustrated by soldiers giving two tins to the representatives of the winning army.

If a verb cannot be illustrated as an action, it must be ascribed a keyword as well. For example, the phrasal verb *get somebody down* (depress) can be presented in the sentence: *He always wins, which is starting to get me down.*, and illustrated with an image of a depressed man who has again lost a game of tennis to a clown:
In this image the keyword for the verb *get* is a *net* (well visible in the picture) and the keyword for *down* is a *clown*.
