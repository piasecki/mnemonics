### KEYWORD METHOD
The keyword method is especially recommended for teaching / learning vocabulary. 
In order to use this method, one has to associate a new foreign word with a similar-sounding native word and then create an image combining both of them. 
For example, a Polish learner of English could associate the word *shop* with *szop* (they sound similar) and imagine the animal selling clothes in a shopping centre. 
The more absurd or the funnier the image, the more memorable it is. The word szop becomes the keyword which helps the learner recall the meaning of shop. 
Similarly, a Polish learner of Spanish could associate the word carta (list) with karton and imagine a postman carrying a huge letter in a carton box.
