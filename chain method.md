### CHAIN METHOD
Another useful mnemonic is the chain method (also known as the link method) which consists in connecting the items to be memorised into some meaningful whole.
Many teachers actually apply this method when they ask their pupils to make up a story with the newly learned words. The story links the words and provides the context for them, and this is how they can be easily remembered. 
It is also possible to combine the items which we need to learn into a rhyme instead of a story, especially when there are not too many of them.
Whenever I need to know how many days a given month has, one can recall the following rhyme: *Thirty days has September, April, June and November*.

Rhyming mnemonics stick in our memories really well and all students will find them very useful when learning the rules for:

-  **spelling** - *I before E except after C* (belIEve, pIEce BUT recEIve),
- **pronunciation** — *When two vowels go walking the first does the talking* (Oat, Eat),
- **articles** — *No matter if you go by bus, by car, by plane or by train, you will never catch me, your effort is vain* (the zero article).
