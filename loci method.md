### Loci method
One of the best known mnemonics is the loci method (in Latin loci is the plural form of locus which means place). As the name itself suggests, this method consists in associating items to be remembered with specific places. If our pupils have to memorise one of the rules for the use of the definite article ("the" is used before the names of cinemas, hotels, theatres, museums, institutions and galleries), they could imagine a sightseeing tour around their hometown or a city they know very well, visiting the places listed. Once they remember the route of their imaginary trip, they will easily recall the items from the rule (Kubiak, 2003).
The loci method can also be used every day for remembering e.g. shopping lists. All of us can easily recall the image of our house, apartment or favourite room with its furniture and other objects. To remember a shopping list we have to associate the items to be bought with the items from our living room, for example. I could imagine a loaf of bread snoring in the armchair, chicken and ham reading a newspaper on the sofa, two cartons of milk watching TV on the carpet, ajar of baby food with headphones on listening to music, etc. When I take an imaginary walk around my living room, I will easily recall the items from my shopping list. I can use the same locations, which serve as pegs in my memory, each time I have a list to remember.
