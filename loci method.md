<h3 align="center"> LOCI METHOD

***



One of the best known mnemonics is the **loci method** (in Latin *loci* is the plural form of *locus* which means *place*). As the name itself suggests, this method consists in associating items to be remembered with specific places. If our pupils have to memorise one of the rules for the use of the definite article (**"the"** is used before the names of cinemas, hotels, theatres, museums, institutions and galleries), they could imagine a sightseeing tour around their hometown or a city they know very well, visiting the places listed. Once they remember the route of their imaginary trip, they will easily recall the items from the rule.

The loci method can also be used every day for remembering e.g. shopping lists. All of us can easily recall the image of our house, apartment or favourite room with its furniture and other objects. To remember a shopping list we have to associate the items to be bought with the items from our living room, for example. You could imagine a loaf of bread snoring in the armchair, chicken and ham reading a newspaper on the sofa, two cartons of milk watching TV on the carpet, a jar of baby food with headphones on listening to music, etc. When you take an imaginary walk around your living room, you will easily recall the items from your shopping list.
