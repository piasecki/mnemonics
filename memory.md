### Memory
One of the best known models of memory is the information — processing model which assumes that human memory works like a computer, i.e. it encodes, stores and retrieves the data we need. 

### SHORT - TERM MEMORY (STM)
A system of limited capacity which retains recently perceived information or information retrieved from long-term memory for about 30 seconds.

### LONG - TERM MEMORY ( LTM )
<h6 align="justify"> A system of unlimited capacity which organises information for permanent storage.

<h6 align="justify"> **Sensory memory**, sometimes referred to as sensory register, comprises all our senses, through which we perceive stimuli from the outside world. The incoming sense impressions are registered in sensory memory for a very brief moment (from a few hundred milliseconds to about 2 seconds) and during that time we select pieces of information for transfer and further processing in STM. The remaining sensory information is permanently lost (forgotten). We can "test" our sensory register by looking at some bright point or light, for example, and after closing our eyes, we shall still be able to "see" light for about half a second. Or we can keep clapping our hands hard for a while and feel how our palms retain the sensation of clapping after we stop. The quick disappearance of sensory information is actually very important as it prevents us from having multiple images and blurred perceptions.
Sensory information which is selected by our attention for further processing goes to short-term memory where it is initially encoded and retained for about 30 seconds. STM can only hold from 5 to 9 pieces of new information at a time and this information is quickly lost unless it is rehearsed (repeated) for as long as it is needed. We use STM when we want to write down the address we have seen on TV screen, for example, or when we want to take notes during a lecture. That is why STM is often called working memory - it stores the information we need at a given moment and gets rid of it when it becomes redundant. Without STM, we would not be able to hold a conversation as we could forget the question before we answered it. Similarly, we would not be able to understand a written text as we would forget the beginning of a sentence or paragraph before we got to the end of it.
People often increase the capacity of their short- term memory by chunking, i.e. by grouping bits of information into larger units. For example, we usually remember telephone numbers in chunks like these: 44-20-185 rather than as single digits. Experienced chess players can remember the position of every single piece on the board after just glancing at it because they group the pieces into a few chunks, which — for them — are standard configurations. However, unlimited STM could only make our lives more difficult as large, accumulated amounts of information would cause chaos and prevent us from thinking clearly. The case of a Russian reporter, Salomon Szereszewski, is probably the best evidence for this. The man could not forget the sensory images or any information he was exposed to. This made him appear slow and awkward — he had problems concentrating on simple, everyday activities or recognising the people he knew when they made even slight changes in their appearance. He ended up as a showman performing memory tricks to audience.
